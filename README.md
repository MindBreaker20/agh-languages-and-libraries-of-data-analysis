# Languages and libraries of data analysis
## Description
This repository was made for the Languages and libraries of data analysis course at the AGH UST in 2022/2023. Repository contains one major project about tautology
and other projects called homeworks.

## Topics
### Project - Tautology
The purpose of this project is writing expression in console in Pycharm to check if mentioned expression is tautology or not. The advantage of my code is that
user can check unlimited number of expressions. The only limits are imagination and Python itself.

Below is an example how described code works. It can be also used as an instruction how to run my program.

### Homeworks - another projects
#### 1. Aho-Corasick Automaton

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is one of the text pattern search algorithms. It finds occurrences of words from a dictionary (a given set of patterns) in the text.
My program returns indexes of every pattern in given text. 

**How to run program**
You can open this program in Pycharm and run it. First you enter your text. After that you are constantly asked to provide patterns. Finally you click enter and program
returns results.
